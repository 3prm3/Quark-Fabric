							<b>Quark</b> is a mod for Minecraft. It aims to create an experience akin to the "vanilla" experience, by having a very simple motto: <i>anything that would be added to Quark could also be added to the default game without compromising its gameplay style.</i>
							<br><br>
							To that end, every feature added to Quark is simple and small. Hence the name of the mod, Quark, as a Quark is a very small thing. Quark is a <i>Modular</i> mod. Which means that its features are split within various modules. All of the modules can be disabled, and all the features can also be disabled individually if one wants to.
							<br><br>
							Check out the various tabs to have a look of what the mod contains. If you're on mobile you can scroll left on the tabs to see more. You can download Quark for Minecraft 1.9 using the download button in the header. Scroll down a bit for installation instructions and other stuff.

							<br><br>

							<b>Installation Instructions</b>
							<br><br>
							This mod requires Minecraft Forge. We do not support Bukkit, Spigot, Cauldron, Sponge or any other alternative servers. Though some <i>may</i> be compatible, if you choose to go that way, you're on your own. <i>The mod is provided as-is, with no warranty. We are not responsible if it breaks or destroys your save. Always make backups.</i>
							<br><br>
							This is just a standard forge mod installation. If you've done it before you can skip this.
							<ol>
								<li>Make sure you have Minecraft installed.</li>
								<li>Locate the version of Minecraft Forge for your target Minecraft version <a href="http://files.minecraftforge.net/">here</a>.</li>
								<li>Download installer-win (or installer if you're not on Windows) and run it. A new forge profile will be added to your minecraft launcher.</li>
								<li>Download Quark using the download button above. Put the downloaded .jar file into your "mods" folder.
									<ul>
										<li>The "mods" folder is next to your "resourcepacks" folder. To locate it, run the new forge instance, open the Resource Packs menu, open the folder, and go one level up to where all your minecraft files are. The "mods" folder should be there alongside others like "screenshots" or "saves".</li></ul></li>
								<li>Run your new forge profile with Quark installed.</li>
							</ol>

							For server installation:
							<ol>
								<li>Follow the above steps, up to step 3. For step 3 pick Server rather than Client, and change the location to an empty folder somewhere.</li>
								<li>Create a "mods" folder inside the empty folder you picked, that now contains your server files.</li>
								<li>Download Quark using the download button above. Put the downloaded .jar file into that "mods" folder.</li>
								<li>Run the server using the forge jar. <i>Not the minecraft_server jar</i></li>
							</ol>

							Alternatively, you can use the <a href="https://www.curse.com/download">Curse app</a> and install the mod directly from inside it. Make sure you have Minecraft installed so it installs the Minecraft plugin.<br>
							Yes, you can use the mod in modpacks.
